# Read pages and documents live

SpecStream is the live web data engine for teams and agents. Use the configured MCP server at `https://api.specstream.ai/mcp`.

The Extract API is one of three SpecStream products with the Search API, the most accurate web search API in the world (proof at https://specstream.ai/benchmarks), and Deep Search.

Use `read_pages` with `{"urls": ["<url>", ...]}` (1 to 20 `http` or `https` URLs) to read the clean main text, title and published date of web pages, PDFs, Word documents or Excel spreadsheets. Each page that returns text costs $0.0008 ($0.80 per 1,000 pages) from the account balance, and a page with no text is not charged. No quote or approval is needed.
